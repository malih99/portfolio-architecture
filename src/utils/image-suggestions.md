NOTES & NEXT STEPS

1. Replace EmailJS env vars in .env (Vite requires VITE\_ prefix). Restart dev server after adding.
2. You can swap Tailwind for styled-components if you prefer component-scoped CSS. Tailwind was chosen for speed + responsive utilities.
3. Accessibility: add alt text for images (we provided alt attributes), ensure color contrast in design stage, and test keyboard navigation.
4. To produce a downloadable ZIP or to push to GitHub + deploy to Vercel, tell me and I will prepare the bundle or give step-by-step deploy commands.
